This is my school web project.

Version 0.7 alpha

Server needed (I used wamp)

Database schema is at db_schema folder so you can actually try out this.

You have to Web-build the same version game at the Webproject_game to fully run this.
Directory to build should be root and folder name should be 'JumpGame_build'

!!Mic input is currently too sensitive. will be fixed in the future.

Used Minecraft, trickal gallery emoj asset
